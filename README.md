  A Windows desktop client for managing Steam manifest/lua configurations, built with WPF on .NET 8.
    
  LuaTools browses and installs manifest sources, edits `stplug-in` lua files (depot pinning,
  per-depot enable/disable), manages unlocker modes, and injects a companion plugin into Steam's
  store pages.
  
  It ships fully translated in 29 languages and auto-updates via Velopack.
